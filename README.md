# vault

The simplest secret management system available for clojure

## Usage

Create a `.vault` file in the project directory containing a map of the keys you wish to store.

```
{:token "lksj19sndox91kntilamxk"
 :url   "https://gates.dev"}
```

Add `[vault.core :refer [vault]]` to your requirements and then query for your keys!

```
(def token (vault :token))
```

Make sure to exclude the `.vault` file from your version control if you want to keep them secure
